[TODO]
Rewrite the pack file stuff to use the settings json, could've just done that but it was before I had that added.
Finish the setup function, making & using custom paths from the settings.
Add rebuilding pack file, didnt have it before cause there was a bug in the tool at the time but is now fixed.

[TODO: FIXES]
Function "exit_processes" if you don't use the console it errors when the game is closed.
When the launcher starts the game, it's suppose to wait until the game is closed before going back to the menu. But it currently starts the menu before that
